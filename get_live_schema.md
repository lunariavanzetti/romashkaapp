# How to Extract Your Live Database Schema

## Method 1: Supabase CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Supabase CLI if not installed
npm install -g supabase

# Login to Supabase
supabase login

# Link to your project
supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF

# Extract schema
supabase db dump --schema-only > current_live_schema.sql
```

## Method 2: Direct Database Connection
```bash
# Using pg_dump (replace with your actual connection details)
pg_dump -h db.YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co -U postgres -d postgres --schema-only > current_live_schema.sql
```

## Method 3: SQL Queries in Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Open SQL Editor
3. Run the queries from extract_schema_info.sql
4. Copy the results and share them with me

## Method 4: Show Me What You Have
You can also just tell me:
- Are you using Supabase Auth or custom user management?
- Which schema file is currently deployed?
- What tables exist in your live database?
