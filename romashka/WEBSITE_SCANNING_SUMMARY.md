### Database Design
```sql
-- Core tables with proper relationships and RLS policies
CREATE TABLE website_scan_jobs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  urls TEXT[] NOT NULL,
  status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'pending',
  progress_percentage INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  scan_settings JSONB,
  -- ... additional fields
);

CREATE TABLE extracted_content (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  scan_job_id UUID REFERENCES website_scan_jobs(id),
  url TEXT NOT NULL,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  content_type VARCHAR(100),
  processing_quality DECIMAL(3,2),
  -- ... additional fields
);
```

### Type Safety
- Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Type-safe API responses and error handling
- Strict typing for content types, scan status, and processing results

### Security Features
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all tables
- User isolation - users can only access their own scan jobs
- Encrypted credential storage for external integrations
- Rate limiting and robots.txt compliance

## Customer Use Case: Alex's E-commerce Store

### Scenario
Alex owns an e-commerce store and wants to train his AI chatbot with knowledge about his business.

### Process Flow
1. **Input URLs**: Alex enters his pricing page, FAQ page, and about page URLs
2. **AI Scanning**: System automatically crawls and extracts content from all pages
3. **Smart Processing**: AI categorizes content and creates knowledge items
4. **Review Process**: Alex reviews and approves extracted knowledge
5. **AI Training**: Bot becomes knowledgeable about Alex's business
6. **Testing**: Alex tests bot responses in playground before going live

### Example Results
```json
{
  "extractedContent": [
    {
      "url": "https://alexstore.com/pricing",
      "content_type": "pricing",
      "processing_quality": 0.95,
      "content": "Our pricing plans include Basic ($9/month), Pro ($29/month)..."
    },
    {
      "url": "https://alexstore.com/faq",
      "content_type": "faq",
      "processing_quality": 0.88,
      "content": "Q: How do I get started? A: Simply sign up and follow..."
    }
  ],
  "knowledgeItems": [
    {
      "title": "Pricing: Basic Plan",
      "content": "Basic plan costs $9 per month. Features: Basic support, 100 products...",
      "category": "pricing",
      "confidence": 0.95
    }
