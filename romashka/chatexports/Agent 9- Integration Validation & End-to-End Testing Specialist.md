  TARGET: Achieve 9/10 production readiness score by validating all integrations
  work correctly.

  Start with environment validation, then test each integration systematically.
  Document everything clearly for Agent 10's final completion work.

  **Copy this prompt into Cursor and run Agent 9!**

  Agent 9 will systematically test every integration and give you a clear picture
   of what's working vs what needs fixing before Agent 10 does the final
  completion work.

  🚀 Ready to validate your integrations!

**Cursor**

I'm Agent 9: Integration Validation & End-to-End Testing Specialist! Let me systematically validate all integrations and achieve 9/10 production readiness. I'll start by examining the codebase structure and testing infrastructure.

Excellent! I can see the codebase already has testing infrastructure in place. Let me examine the key testing files and start the systematic validation process.

Perfect! I can see we have a comprehensive testing infrastructure. Let me start the systematic validation process by running the environment validation script first.

I see that no API credentials are configured yet. Let me check the .env file and see what's available, then run the database test to see if at least the database connection is working.

Great! There is a .env file. Let me examine its contents to see what credentials are actually available:

Let me check the .env file contents to understand the current credential status:

I can see the issue now. The .env file contains placeholder values rather than real credentials. The user mentioned they have configured real API credentials, but the .env file still contains placeholder values. Let me explore the actual services and testing capabilities to understand what we can test:

Now I have a complete picture of the testing infrastructure and services. Let me create a comprehensive **Integration Status Report** and run systematic tests with the available resources.

Now let me create a comprehensive **Integration Status Report** and run the available tests:

Let me create a comprehensive **Integration Status Report** based on my analysis and create an end-to-end testing document:
