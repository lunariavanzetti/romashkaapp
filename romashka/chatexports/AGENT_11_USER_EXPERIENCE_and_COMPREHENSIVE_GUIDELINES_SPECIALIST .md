### ROI Calculation Methods

**Method 1: Cost Savings Analysis**
```
Calculation:
Monthly Cost Savings = (Previous Labor Cost - Current Labor Cost) + (Efficiency Gains √ó Hourly Rate)

Example:
- Previous monthly labor cost: $15,000
- Current monthly labor cost: $10,000
- Efficiency gains: 40 hours/month
- Average hourly rate: $25/hour
- Monthly savings: ($15,000 - $10,000) + (40 √ó $25) = $6,000
- Annual ROI: $6,000 √ó 12 = $72,000
```

**Method 2: Revenue Impact Analysis**
```
Calculation:
Monthly Revenue Impact = (Increased Conversions √ó Average Order Value) + (Improved Retention √ó Customer Lifetime Value)

Example:
- Increased conversions: 50/month
- Average order value: $150
- Improved retention: 10 customers/month
- Customer lifetime value: $1,200
- Monthly revenue impact: (50 √ó $150) + (10 √ó $1,200) = $19,500
- Annual ROI: $19,500 √ó 12 = $234,000
```

**Method 3: Productivity Analysis**
```
Calculation:
Monthly Productivity Gain = (Time Saved √ó Hourly Rate) + (Quality Improvement √ó Customer Value)

Example:
- Time saved: 100 hours/month
- Average hourly rate: $30/hour
- Quality improvement: 20% increase in satisfaction
- Customer value impact: $500/month
- Monthly productivity gain: (100 √ó $30) + $500 = $3,500
- Annual ROI: $3,500 √ó 12 = $42,000
