## 🎯 Phase 1: Basic Data Verification Tests

### Test 1.1: Verify Sync Status
**Endpoint:** `https://romashkaai.vercel.app/api/test-sync`

**Expected Result:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "HubSpot sync completed successfully!",
  "result": {
    "contacts": 5,
    "deals": 3,
    "total_synced": 8,
    "last_sync_at": "2025-07-26T12:07:33.437Z"
  }
}
```

**✅ Status:** PASS - ✅ Working correctly

---

## 🎯 Phase 2: AI-Integration Bridge Testing

### Test 2.1: Test Integration Query Detection

**Test in Chat Widget/Playground:**

#### Customer/Contact Queries:
```
Query: "Who are our customers?"
Expected: AI should detect this as integration query and fetch contact data
Test Response Should Include: Real contact names and companies from your HubSpot

Query: "Do we have any contacts from [company name]?"
Expected: AI searches through synced contacts for specific company

Query: "Show me our customer list"
Expected: AI displays formatted list of your 5 synced contacts

Query: "What customer information do we have?"
Expected: AI provides overview of contact database with companies
```

#### Sales/Deal Queries:
```
Query: "What deals are in our pipeline?"
Expected: AI fetches and displays your 3 active deals with amounts and stages

Query: "Show me our sales opportunities"
Expected: AI lists deals with values and current stages

Query: "What's our total pipeline value?"
Expected: AI calculates and shows sum of all deal amounts

Query: "Do we have any high-value deals?"
Expected: AI identifies deals above certain threshold
```

#### General Business Queries:
```
Query: "Give me a business overview"
Expected: AI provides summary of all integration data (contacts + deals)

Query: "What's our CRM status?"
Expected: AI shows comprehensive view of customer and sales data
```

### Test 2.2: Non-Integration Queries (Should NOT trigger data fetch)
```
Query: "What's the weather today?"
Expected: AI responds normally without fetching integration data

Query: "How do I use this platform?"
Expected: Regular AI response, no CRM data fetching
```

---

## 🎯 Phase 3: Smart Knowledge Generation Testing

### Test 3.1: Manual Knowledge Generation
**Access Integration Admin Panel:**
1. Go to `/integrations` page
2. Look for "Generate Knowledge" or "Smart Knowledge" button
3. Click to trigger knowledge generation from synced data

### Test 3.2: Verify Generated Knowledge
**After knowledge generation, test these queries:**

```
Query: "What do you know about our business?"
Expected: AI uses auto-generated knowledge entries

Query: "Tell me about our customer base"
Expected: AI references generated customer overview knowledge

Query: "What's our sales situation?"
Expected: AI uses generated sales pipeline knowledge
```

### Test 3.3: Knowledge Base Integration
**Check Knowledge Base:**
1. Go to knowledge base section
2. Look for entries with source: "integration_auto_generated"
3. Verify knowledge entries include:
   - Customer Database Overview
   - Sales Pipeline Overview
   - Business Overview Summary

---

## 🎯 Phase 4: Frontend Integration Testing

### Test 4.1: Chat Widget Enhancement
**Test Location:** Chat widget in playground or embedded widget

**Test Scenarios:**
1. **Contact Lookup:**
   ```
   User: "Do you have contact info for john@example.com?"
   Expected: AI searches synced contacts and provides specific info
   ```

2. **Deal Status Inquiry:**
   ```
   User: "What's the status of our biggest deal?"
   Expected: AI identifies highest-value deal and reports stage
   ```

3. **Business Metrics:**
   ```
   User: "How many customers do we have?"
   Expected: AI reports exact count (5) from synced data
   ```

### Test 4.2: Real-time Data Access
**Verify the AI can access:**
- ✅ Contact names, emails, companies
- ✅ Deal names, amounts, stages
- ✅ Business summary statistics
- ✅ Real-time search functionality

---

## 🎯 Phase 5: Advanced Integration Testing

### Test 5.1: Context-Aware Responses
```
Conversation Flow:
User: "Who are our customers?"
AI: [Lists 5 contacts with companies]

User: "Tell me more about [specific company mentioned]"
AI: [Should provide detailed info about that company's contacts/deals]

User: "Do we have any deals with them?"
AI: [Searches deals for matching contact emails/companies]
```

### Test 5.2: Data Freshness Testing
1. Make a change in your HubSpot test account
2. Trigger sync via: `https://romashkaai.vercel.app/api/test-sync`
3. Test AI queries to verify updated data is accessible

---

## 🎯 Phase 6: Error Handling & Edge Cases

### Test 6.1: No Data Scenarios
```
Query: "Do we have any contacts from XYZ Corp?"
Expected: AI should gracefully handle when no matches found

Query: "Show me deals worth over $1 million"
Expected: AI should handle cases where no deals meet criteria
```

### Test 6.2: Permission Testing
- Test AI access with and without user authentication
- Verify data security (AI only accesses user's own data)

---

## 🎯 Phase 7: Performance & Reliability Testing

### Test 7.1: Response Time
- Measure AI response time for integration queries vs regular queries
- Integration queries should respond within 3-5 seconds

### Test 7.2: Concurrent Testing
- Test multiple integration queries simultaneously
- Verify system stability under load

---

## 📊 Expected Test Results Summary

### ✅ PASS Criteria:
1. **Data Access:** AI can fetch and display your 5 contacts and 3 deals
2. **Query Detection:** AI correctly identifies integration-related questions
3. **Context Formatting:** AI presents data in readable, helpful format
4. **Knowledge Generation:** System creates relevant knowledge entries
5. **Real-time Updates:** Fresh data appears after sync
6. **Security:** Only your data is accessible to your AI sessions

### ❌ FAIL Indicators:
- AI says "I don't have access to your CRM data"
- Integration queries return empty responses
- AI doesn't detect contact/deal keywords
- Knowledge generation fails or creates empty entries
- Outdated data appears after sync

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Testing Commands

### Step 1: Verify Current Sync
```bash
curl https://romashkaai.vercel.app/api/test-sync
```

### Step 2: Test Basic Integration Query
Go to chat widget and ask: **"Who are our customers?"**

### Step 3: Test Deal Pipeline Query  
Ask: **"What deals do we have in our sales pipeline?"**

### Step 4: Test Business Overview
Ask: **"Give me a summary of our business data"**

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If AI doesn't access integration data:
1. Check if you're logged in as the correct user
2. Verify HubSpot sync completed successfully
3. Ensure chat is using enhanced aiService with user context
4. Check browser console for integration bridge errors

### If knowledge generation fails:
1. Verify integration data exists in database
2. Check knowledge_base table for auto-generated entries
3. Trigger manual knowledge generation
4. Review service logs for generation errors
